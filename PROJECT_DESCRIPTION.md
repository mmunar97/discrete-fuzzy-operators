FuzzyDiscreteOperators is a library to operate with discrete fuzzy operators (discrete aggregation functions, 
discrete t-norms, discrete t-conorms, discrete copulas, discrete uninorms, etc). Each family of operators mentioned 
above has in turn different subfamilies; in this library, they are also implemented as SN-implications, R-operators, 
quasi-copulas, t-subnorms, etc.

Since these operators are useful in other applied fields, the library contains the `decision_making` module, with 
emphasis on discrete fuzzy numbers, two tuples and ordinal Yager decision functions. They are also very useful in 
mathematical morphology. For more information, see [Discrete Fuzzy Morphology](https://github.com/mmunar97/discrete_fuzzy_morphology).
